this repo proposes a optimal selective assembly Method for remanufacturing  product considering quality,cost and resource utilization

## Abstract
  Aiming to poor assembly accuracy, low utilization of remanufacturing resource and low assembly efficiency in the process 
of remanufacturing assembly, a new selective assembly method optimization for remanufactured machinery is proposed. Considering
assembly accuracy, utilization of remanufactured parts and assembly efficiency, Taguchi quality loss function(QLF) and cost function 
of remaining parts are both employed. Ensuring assembly accuracy and minimum cost, a comprehensive matching model is 
established with closed loop dimension chain as the constraint condition, and the solution procedure of PSO-GA model is given to 
obtain the optimal matching scheme. Uncertainties and resource wastes causing by unreasonable matching schemes are both reduced
to ensure the quality of remanufactured machine. Finally, the spindle box of a wasted CAK6163 is selected to implement optimization 
and matching to the reassembly procedure, and the results show the proposed method can not only eliminate the problem of low 
success rate in remanufactured parts matching process, but also greatly improve the utilization of remanufacturing resource and
reduce the cost
